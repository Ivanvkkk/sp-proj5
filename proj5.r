## This project implement such a demographic model for England and Wales, 
## to predict the expected number of deaths per week from the beginning of 2020
## if death rates had stayed at the levels seen in 2017-19. The model will
## include an adjustment to allow for seasonal variation in mortality rates. 
## compare this to the actual deaths per week that occurred over this period1,
## to obtain an excess deaths time series, and then model this series using
## a simple Bayesian model in JAGS.
